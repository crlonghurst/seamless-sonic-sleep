To get Spotify to Work:
    Spotify needs to be installed on the Android emulator.
    Need a unique client id
    Need a development fingerprint
    Need a callback url which
    Need to login into the Spotify Developer Dashboard
        Where you get your unique client id
        Add the callback url in the settings
        Add the development fingerprint in the settings

Spotify Dependencies:
    The authentication library and the app remote need to be added to the dependencies in the build.gradle module in order to use them.

Additional guides from Spotify:

Overall would like to have Spotify as another option among system sounds/ringtones and local audio files to use for the alarms.
